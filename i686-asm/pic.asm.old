; PIC macros - model 8259A (see Intel datasheet)
; The programmable interrupt controller consists of PIC1 and PIC2 with the following I/O ports
; PIC1: control 0x20, data 0x21
; PIC2: control 0xa0, data 0xa1
; in cascade mode, PIC2 acts as a slave and interrupts are cascaded
; at system startup:
;	IRQ 0..7 = INT 08h..0Fh (=> default offset 08h)
;	IRQ 8..15 = 70h..77h (=> default offset 70h)
